 * Post-event notifications. Called after the security-critical state change
 * has already succeeded — these emails inform the user; they are not part of
 * the action itself, so failures here must never roll back the underlying op.
 *
 * Public mutations rather than internalMutations so the client can fire them
 * immediately after a BA call succeeds. The recipient address is always
 * read from the authenticated user (server-side), never from client input —
 * so the endpoint cannot be abused to spam arbitrary inboxes.
