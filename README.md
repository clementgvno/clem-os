# albo — l'ouvre-boîte

Opinionated B2B SaaS MVP starter: **TanStack Start + Convex + Better Auth + Resend + Anthropic + Tailwind v4**.

Multi-tenant by default (orgs, members, invitations, roles), with an AI chat
sidebar wired in, transactional emails, rate-limiting, and CI/CD on day one.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites**

- **Node 22+** (LTS recommended) — enforced by `engines` in `package.json`
- **pnpm** — enable it once via Corepack (bundled with Node): `corepack enable`.
  Do **not** install pnpm globally: the version is pinned by `packageManager`
  in `package.json`, and Corepack fetches exactly that one. A different pnpm
  major breaks every script — see `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.
- **git**

**1. Get the code**

This repo is a GitHub template. Either click **"Use this template"** on
GitHub to create your own repo, or clone it directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Albo-Club/albo-ouvre-boite.git my-project
cd my-project
```

> **Personalize with `pnpm run setup` — never by hand.** The wizard (step 2,
> via `scripts/init.mjs`) renames the brand consistently across every file,
> swaps in a clean product README, and de-templatizes `CLAUDE.md`. A manual
> `sed`/find-replace will miss files and leave a half-template project — which
> is exactly the mess this script exists to prevent.

**2. Configure everything**

One interactive command. It installs dependencies (if needed), logs you into
Convex, provisions your backend, and collects your API keys:

```bash
pnpm run setup
```

> Use `pnpm run setup`, **not** `pnpm setup` — `setup` is a reserved pnpm
> built-in (it configures `PNPM_HOME`), so the bare form never reaches this
> project's script.
>
> The Convex step opens a browser to log you in and asks you to create a
> project (pick **cloud deployment**). It pushes your functions once and
> returns to the wizard automatically — no Ctrl-C needed.

**3. Start the app**

Run this in its own terminal — it stays in the foreground (Vite + Convex
together):

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** and create your first account.

`pnpm run setup` walks you through everything :

1. **Dependencies** — runs `pnpm install` if `node_modules` is missing.
2. **Project name** — rebrands page titles, agent identity, cookie prefix.
3. **Convex backend** — opens a browser to log in, provisions your dev
   deployment, writes `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` + `VITE_CONVEX_URL` to `.env.local`.
4. **API keys** — prompts for Anthropic + Resend with direct dashboard links
   so you don't have to hunt for the URLs.
5. **Better Auth secret** — auto-generated.
6. **Google OAuth** *(optional)* — prompts for `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` /
   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`; press Enter to skip. When set, a "Continue with
   Google" button appears on `/login` and `/register`; otherwise it stays
   hidden. Authorized redirect URI: `${SITE_URL}/api/auth/callback/google`.
   See `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` § "Google OAuth (template — opt-in)".

It's idempotent — re-run any time, each step skips if already done.

The first user across the deployment becomes `superAdmin: true` automatically.

If you'd rather rebrand without touching Convex, `pnpm run init my-project
--reset-git` runs just the rename step.

## Auth model

- `users.superAdmin: boolean` for deployment-wide privileges.
- `organizationMembers.role`: `owner` > `admin` > `member`.
- Roles are **never** stored on the Better Auth user table.
- Every Convex query/mutation reads roles via `requireAppUser` / `requireOrgRole` / `requireSuperAdmin`.
- Invitations: 7-day expiry, token *is* the credential; UI never bounces the
  invitee through sign-in unless the email already has an account.
- Last-owner protection on every demote/remove path.

## AI chat

The `AiChat` slide-over uses the Convex Agent's React hooks
(`useUIMessages`) so streaming deltas arrive via WebSocket — no manual SSE
plumbing. Threads are keyed by `${orgId}:${userId}`.

The chat agent ships with **DB-acting tools** (`convex/agentTools.ts`) so it
can list / create / update / delete `items` for the user's current org —
membership is re-checked inside every tool via the thread's scope key.
Tool calls cap out at 5 rounds per turn (`stepCountIs(5)`).

There's also an HTTP streaming endpoint at `<convex-site-url>/api/chat` for
clients that prefer plain HTTP streaming (curl, custom clients).

## Deploy to Vercel

The frontend runs on Vercel (serverless via Nitro's Vercel preset); the
Convex backend deploys to Convex Cloud separately.

**Project setup (one-time)**

1. Install the Vercel CLI on the fly: `pnpm dlx vercel@latest login`.
2. From the repo root: `pnpm dlx vercel@latest link` — pick the team and
   project (creates `.vercel/project.json`, gitignored).
3. Verify the framework override is in place: `vercel.json` must contain
   `"framework": null`. Vercel's auto-detection lands on the **Vite**
   preset (which expects `dist/`), but Nitro outputs the Build Output API
   layout in `.vercel/output/`. The override is what kills the 404.
4. Make sure `vite.config.ts` loads `nitro()` from `nitro/vite` in the
   plugin chain — without it the build emits a plain Node server that
   Vercel can't serve.

**Per-environment env vars (Production at minimum)**

```bash
# client-exposed Convex endpoints (build-time inlined into the bundle)
pnpm dlx vercel@latest env add VITE_CONVEX_URL production
pnpm dlx vercel@latest env add VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL production
# optional: same two for `preview` if you use PR preview deploys
```

For a real production setup, also provision a separate Convex prod
deployment instead of pointing at your `dev:` one:

```bash
pnpm exec convex deploy                            # creates prod
# grab the prod Deploy Key from the Convex dashboard, then:
pnpm dlx vercel@latest env add CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY production
```

Then set the Vercel build command to
`pnpm exec convex deploy --cmd "pnpm build"` — Convex deploys the
backend and injects `VITE_CONVEX_URL` automatically (the manual VITE_*
env vars become unnecessary).

**Convex prod env** — one command, instead of pasting 8 `convex env set`:

```bash
pnpm run setup:prod
```

The script prompts for your prod domain, reads your dev env, mirrors the
secrets (Resend, Anthropic, optional Sentry, and the Google OAuth credentials
if you set them in dev) to prod, generates a **fresh** `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
(never reused from dev — same secret across envs would let a dev session token
unlock prod), sets `APP_ENV=production`, `SITE_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`,
`RESEND_TEST_MODE=false`, and runs `convex deploy`.

If Google OAuth is mirrored, the script reminds you to register the prod
redirect URI (`https://<your-domain>/api/auth/callback/google`) on the **same**
Google Cloud OAuth client you use for dev — the credentials are mirrored
automatically, but the redirect URI must be added by hand in the Google
console, or Google sign-in returns `redirect_uri_mismatch`.

`APP_ENV=production` activates a boot-time guard in `convex/auth.ts` that
refuses to start if `SITE_URL` still points at `localhost` — this is what
prevents shipping magic-link / invitation emails with broken `localhost`
links.

If you prefer the manual route:

```bash
pnpm exec convex env set --prod BETTER_AUTH_SECRET "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
pnpm exec convex env set --prod BETTER_AUTH_URL https://<your-domain>
pnpm exec convex env set --prod SITE_URL https://<your-domain>
pnpm exec convex env set --prod ANTHROPIC_API_KEY sk-ant-...
pnpm exec convex env set --prod RESEND_API_KEY re_...
pnpm exec convex env set --prod RESEND_FROM "hello@yourdomain.com"
pnpm exec convex env set --prod RESEND_TEST_MODE false
pnpm exec convex env set --prod APP_ENV production
# optional — only if you use Google social login
pnpm exec convex env set --prod GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID <id>
pnpm exec convex env set --prod GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET <secret>
pnpm exec convex deploy
```

**Verify a deploy**

```bash
pnpm dlx vercel@latest ls --prod                   # latest deployments
pnpm dlx vercel@latest inspect <url> --wait        # block until Ready
curl -sI https://<your-vercel-domain>/             # expect HTTP 200
```

## CI / Ops

- `ci.yml` — lint (tsc + eslint) + build on push/PR, plus a `skills-drift`
  job that checks SKILL.md files against upstream. When it goes red, run
  `pnpm run sync:skills`, review the diff, commit. Zero repo settings
  needed — this is the whole skills freshness chain. (A cron + auto-PR
  workflow used to exist; see `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` for why it was removed.)
- `release-tag.yml` — publishes the git tag for `.template-version` when a
  release bump merges to `main`. The downstream `pnpm run upgrade-template`
  channel depends on these tags.
- Renovate — weekly, groups non-majors, automerges devDeps, freezes the
  pinned `pnpm.overrides` until you bump them. Also bumps action versions
  in `.github/workflows/*` (the `github-actions` manager is on by default
  in `config:recommended`).

**Day 1 of a derived repo** — one setting, the only piece that can't ship
inside the template: install the
[Renovate GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/renovate) on the repo (org
install → select the repo); `renovate.json` does nothing until the app is
in. Done when your first PR has green CI and Renovate has opened its
onboarding PR.

## Convex MCP server

A project-scoped `.mcp.json` ships the Convex MCP server so Claude Code
(and any MCP-aware tool launched from this repo) can read logs, list
tables, run queries, and inspect functions on your **personal dev**
deployment. Approve the server prompt the first time you open the repo
in Claude Code.

Safe by default:

- Only reads `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` from your local `.env.local` (each dev
  hits their own deployment — no shared state, no secrets in the JSON).
- Prod is blocked unless you opt in with
  `--dangerously-enable-production-deployments`; PII reads on prod
  require `--cautiously-allow-production-pii`. Don't change the
  committed config to flip these — pass the flag in your own
  `~/.claude.json` if you ever need it.

## Resend plugin (Claude Code)

`.claude/settings.json` enables the official **Resend** Claude Code plugin
at project scope (`resend@claude-plugins-official`). It bundles the Resend
**MCP server** (send/receive email, manage templates, agent inbox) and every
Resend **skill** (React Email, deliverability best practices), and it
**auto-updates** through Anthropic's official marketplace — no manual sync,
the skills stay current on their own.

The MCP server reads `RESEND_API_KEY` from the environment Claude Code passes
it. Put it in the **gitignored** `.claude/settings.local.json` (repo-scoped,
never committed):

```json
{ "env": { "RESEND_API_KEY": "re_..." } }
```

Then **restart Claude Code** (or `/reload-plugins`) to apply. If the plugin is
missing, refresh the marketplace once with
`/plugin marketplace update claude-plugins-official`. A shell-profile
`export RESEND_API_KEY=re_…` works too.

> This dev-tooling `RESEND_API_KEY` is **separate** from the
> `RESEND_API_KEY` the app uses at runtime, which lives in the Convex env.
> See `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` § "Resend: two integrations".

## Common commands

```bash
pnpm dev                          # vite + convex dev (concurrently)
pnpm typecheck                    # tsc --noEmit
pnpm run sync:skills              # pull latest SKILL.md files (self-healing)
pnpm run sync:skills:verify       # exit 2 if the vendored tree diverged (offline)
pnpm run sync:skills:check        # exit 2 if any drifted from upstream
pnpm run init <name>              # personalize template
pnpm run upgrade-template         # merge upstream template changes (see PORTING.md)
pnpm exec convex env list         # inspect Convex env vars
pnpm exec convex run admin:purgeExcept '{"keepEmail":"you@yourco.com"}'
```

## Maintaining this template

This repo is the **source** template. Three things keep derived projects clean:

1. **The GitHub "Template repository" flag.** Enable it once so "Use this
   template" creates repos *without* inheriting this history:

   ```bash
   gh repo edit Albo-Club/albo-ouvre-boite --template
   # verify: gh repo view Albo-Club/albo-ouvre-boite --json isTemplate
   ```

   (Or toggle **Settings → Template repository** in the GitHub UI.)

2. **`pnpm run setup` / `pnpm run init <name>` is the only supported way to
   personalize a derivative.** `scripts/init.mjs` discovers files dynamically
   (`git ls-files`), brand-replaces them, renders the product README, and
   asserts zero residual brand token — failing loudly if anything is missed.
   The upstream identity `Albo-Club/albo-ouvre-boite` is preserved so the
   `pnpm run upgrade-template` channel keeps working downstream.

3. **Tag releases with `pnpm run release vX.Y.Z`.** Write the release notes
   in `CHANGELOG.md` first (and migration steps in `UPGRADING.md` if any),
   then run the script: it syncs `.template-version`, commits, tags, and
   tells you what to push. The tag is what lets "Use this template" snapshots
   (no shared git history) graft ancestry on their first
   `pnpm run upgrade-template` — without a pushed tag, that first upgrade
   fails downstream.
